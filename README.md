# Vehicle-Detection-in-Unstructured-Environment

Using the Indian Driving Data set we have trained a Faster RCNN model using the Transfer Learning and got a good MAP for the same.
# What is Unstructured Environment ?

->Unstructured environment is an environment that contains many obstacles and where vehicle localization is difficult. 
->Most natural environments in India are unstructured.
->Scenarios like dense traffic condition and places where there are many obstacles ,detection in such environment is difficult.
->There is no lane information to guide or constrain the actions of the vehicle,current algorithms donâ€™t generalize well when tested on diverse data distributions.
 ->It is a challenging task in unstructured environments where lanes vary significantly in appearance and are not indicated by proper markers.

# About Dataset Indian Driving Dataset 
Indian Driving Dataset (IDD) - 
 In recent years several datasets are available for autonomous navigation tend to focus on structured driving environments which corresponds to well-delineated infrastructure such as lanes, a small number of well-defined categories for traffic participants, low variation in object or background appearance and strong adherence to traffic rules.
IDD, is a novel dataset for road scene understanding in unstructured environments. 
It consists of 10,004 images, finely annotated with 34 classes collected from 182 drive sequences on Indian roads.
